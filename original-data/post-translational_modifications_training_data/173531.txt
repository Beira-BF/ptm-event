The covalent structure of collagen.  The amino-acid sequence of alpha2-CB4 from calf-skin collagen. 
Sequencing of chymotrypsin, trypsin, collagenase- and hydroxylamine-derived peptides, using the automated Edman degradation procedure, yielded the complete amino acid sequence of alpha2-CB4 from calf skin collagen (321 residues).  Together with the data from earlier work, an uninterrupted sequence in the helical region of the alpha2-chain from residues 1-393 is now known. Glycine is found in every third position of the peptide.  Hydroxylation of proline and lysine occurs only in the Y-position of the triplet Gly-X-Y and is not complete in every position.  Some residues, such as glutamic acid, leucine, phenylalanine and arginine, are distributed non-randomly between the X and Y-positions and this non-random distribution is different in the alpha1 and alpha2-chains.  Comparison of the N-terminal 393 residues from the helical region of the alpha1 and alpha2-chains revealed a nearly identical distribution of charged polar residues arginine, lysine, glutamic and aspartic acids.  The distribution of the triplet Gly-Pro-Hyp is simialr in both chains.  The remaining residues in the alpha2-chain exhibit a high degree of substitutions when compared with those in the alpha1-chain.  Approximately one in every two residues in both the X and Y-positions are substituted.
