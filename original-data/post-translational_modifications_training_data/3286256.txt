Primary structure of glycolate oxidase from spinach. 
The primary structure of glycolate oxidase from spinach has been determined. Six different types of peptide digest were investigated, utilizing CNBr, proteolytic enzymes, and chemical modifications to change a specificity of cleavage. In total, 90 peptides were purified and analyzed. The studies were aimed at correlation with crystallographic analysis of the same protein carried through in parallel and with cDNA studies which utilized initially determined amino acid sequences for synthesis of oligonucleotide probes. Continuous comparisons with the results from the crystallographic studies helped at an early stage to secure peptide overlaps, at the same time as the peptide data secured residue assignments in the electron density maps. In the end, all data agree and regions from all parts of the molecule have been checked by independent methods of analysis. The primary structure establishes the type of N-terminal post-translational processing, and yields information on segments not fully defined in electron density maps. Combined, the chemical, crystallographic, and cDNA data give extensive reliability. The peptide analysis shows that the N-terminus is blocked by acylation of the initiator methionine, which is in a primary structure typical for non-removal of the methionine in the processing events of the nascent protein chain. The molecule is comparatively rich in menthionine and some other generally less common residues, but has only one cysteine residue and no extensive hydrophobic segment. An amino acid sequence homology with flavocytochrome b2 from yeast, as expected from known similarities in tertiary structure, is observed (33% residue identities).
