All three potential N-glycosylation sites of the dog kidney (Na+ + K+)-ATPase beta-subunit contain oligosaccharide. 
The beta-subunit of dog kidney (Na+ + K+)-ATPase is a sialoglycoprotein and contains three potential N-glycosylation sites. In this study, the oligosaccharide chains of purified dog kidney beta-subunit were labeled with tritium by oxidation with sodium periodate or galactose oxidase followed by NaB3H4 reduction. The beta-subunit was extensively digested by trypsin and the radioactive peptides were purified by HPLC. The enzyme, glycopeptidase A, which catalyzes the removal of N-linked oligosaccharide chains and the conversion of the glycosylated Asn residue to Asp, was used to demonstrate that a number of purified beta-subunit tryptic peptides were glycosylated. Amino-acid analysis of these beta-subunit peptides following glycopeptidase-A treatment revealed the expected Asn to Asp conversion for Asn-157, Asn-192 and Asn-264, demonstrating that all three potential N-glycosylation sites of the dog kidney beta-subunit are glycosylated. In addition, amino-acid sequence data suggest that a disulfide bond exists between Cys-158 and Cys-174.
