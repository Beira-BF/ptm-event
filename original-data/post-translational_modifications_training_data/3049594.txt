Bovine factor VII. Its purification and complete amino acid sequence. 
A modified method for purification of blood clotting factor VII from bovine plasma was developed, and its complete amino acid sequence was established.  The isolated factor VII was activated with factor XIIa, and the resulting two-chain factor VII (factor VIIa) was reduced and S-pyridylethylated or S-aminoethylated.  The amino acid sequences of the S-alkylated heavy and light chains were determined by sequencing the fragments obtained from enzymatic and chemical cleavages.  Fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry was also used to establish the COOH-terminal sequence of the heavy chain.  The light chain consists of 152 residues with one carbohydrate chain at Asn145, and 11 gamma-carboxyglutamic acid residues are found within the NH2-terminal 35 residues.  The light chain contains 0.2-0.3 mol of beta-hydroxyaspartic acid/mol of protein, indicating that an aspartic acid residue in bovine factor VII is incompletely hydroxylated. Moreover, a pentapeptide, Ala-Ser*-Ser-Pro-Cys (positions 51-55), isolated from an enzymatic digest of the light chain, contained an unknown serine derivative, but its structure is still unclear.  On the other hand, the heavy chain is composed of 255 residues and one asparagine-linked carbohydrate chain at Asn203.  Bovine factor VII, with a total of 407 residues, has 71% sequence identity with the human molecule (406 residues) predicted from the cDNA sequence (Hagen, F. S., Gray, C. L., O'Hara, P., Grant, F.
