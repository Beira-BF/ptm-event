Human spleen histone H1. Isolation and amino acid sequence of a main variant, H1b. 
The complete amino acid sequence of a main variant, H1b, of human spleen histone H1 was determined, following previous determinations of human spleen histones H2B, H2A, H3, and H4.  High-performance liquid chromatography on C8 silica of the H1 fraction yielded the homogeneous H1b subfraction; this variant was estimated to account for 60% of the total of the four H1 variants.  The sequence determination was performed with four main fragments, I to IV, obtained by limited chymotryptic digestion of H1b.  Together with direct sequencing by automated Edman degradation of fragments II, III, and IV, fragment I, blocked at the N-terminal, and fragment IV, the C-terminal half the H1b molecule, were sequenced after further digestion with staphylococcal protease and others.  The four fragments were aligned with three overlapping peptides each derived from chymotryptic partial fragments, I-II and I-II-III, and intact H1b.  Carboxypeptidase digestion of intact H1b confirmed the C-terminal sequence of the molecule.  Thus, the total sequence of H1b was completely determined; it consists of a total of 218 amino acid residues, has a molecular weight of 21,734 in the unmodified form, and is completely acetylated at the N-terminal serine residue and partially methylated at the lysine residue 25.  This sequence is compared with two mammalian somatic H1 sequences.
