The primary structure of histone H2A from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. 
The complete primary structure of histone H2A from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans was determined. The amino acid chain consists of 126 amino acid residues and has a blocked N-terminus. By comparison with calf thymus histone H2A, the nematode protein shows five deletions, two insertions and 16 substitutions. Most of the changes occur in the N- and C-terminal regions of the molecule, whereas the central part covering the residues 21-120 is quite well conserved. The lysine residues 5, 8 and 10 were found to be partially acetylated.
