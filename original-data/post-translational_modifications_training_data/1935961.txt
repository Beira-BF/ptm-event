Tricholongins BI and BII, 19-residue peptaibols from Trichoderma longibrachiatum. Solution structure from two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. 
Two nonadecapeptides, tricholongins BI and BII, which display antifungal and antibacterial activities, have been isolated from in vitro cultures of the fungus Trichoderma longibrachiatum. The peptides were separated by reversed-phase HPLC; their amino acid compositions were determined by gas chromatography and their sequences by positive-ion fast-atom-bombardment mass spectrometry and high-field NMR. These linear peptides, containing mainly hydrophobic L-amino acids, 8-9 2-aminoisobutyric acid residues and exhibiting an acetylated N-terminal residue and an amino alcohol C-terminal leucinol belong to the peptaibol class. The methanol solution structure of tricholongins BI and BII has been investigated using both one- and two-dimensional NMR techniques. The total 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR assignments are given. By a combination of the 3JNH,C alpha H coupling constant values, temperature coefficients of the NH and CO groups, amide hydrogen/deuterium-exchange rate measurements and NOE data, a secondary structure for tricholongins in solution has been proposed. Both peptides adopt a similar alpha-helical conformation with a hinge around Pro13 resulting from two 3(10) bonds. The results suggest that the N-terminus contains mixed alpha/3(10) bonds. The membrane permeability modifications induced by tricholongins have been assayed by the use of liposomes composed of egg phosphatidylcholine with 20-30% cholesterol. The peptide-induced leakage of an entrapped fluorescent probe has been followed by fluorescence spectroscopy. In a concentration range of 0.13-0.31 microM, tricholongins induce the leakage of 50% of the entrapped material in 20 min.
