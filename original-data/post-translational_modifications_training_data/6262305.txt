The complete amino acid sequence of bovine heart cytochrome oxidase subunit VI. 
The amino acid sequence of subunit VI derived from bovine heart cytochrome oxidase has been completed and is a single polypeptide chain consisting of 85 amino acid residues. The sequence is: acetyl (formula: see text). The NH2 terminus of subunit VI is blocked with an acetyl group and the molecular weight of the native protein including the acetyl group is 10,067. From the sequence of subunit VI, it is obvious that this subunit corresponds to polypeptide VII of Steffens et al. (Steffens, G. C. M., Steffens, G. J., and Buse, G. (1979) Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 360, 1641-1650).
