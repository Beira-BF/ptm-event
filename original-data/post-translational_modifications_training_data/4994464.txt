Localization of methylated arginine in the A1 protein from myelin. 
Methylated arginine residues are found at only one site (position 107) of the polypeptide chain of the A1 protein, as shown by analysis of tryptic and peptic peptides; these analyses show 0.2 mole of N(G)-dimethylarginine and 0.4-0.8 mole of N(G)-monomethylarginine per mole of A1 protein.
