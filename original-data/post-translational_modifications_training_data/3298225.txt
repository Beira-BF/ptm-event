A second type of protein methylation reaction in bacterial chemotaxis. 
CheZ is the product of one of six genes required for sensory processing in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium chemotaxis.  This 24-kDa cytoplasmic protein is modified by a posttranslational methylation reaction.  The modified residue has been identified by analysis of radioactively labeled protein from two-dimensional electrophoretograms and Edman degradation of CheZ protein isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography using anti-CheZ monoclonal antibodies.  The methylated group is an N-monomethylmethionine residue at the amino terminus of CheZ. L16, a ribosomal protein that is required for peptidyltransferase activity during protein synthesis, is also methylated at its amino-terminal methionine (Chen, R., Brosius, J., and Wittmann-Liebold, B. (1977) J. Mol. Biol. 111, 173-181).  Homologous sequences at the amino termini of L16 and CheZ raise the possibility that a single S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase modifies both proteins.
