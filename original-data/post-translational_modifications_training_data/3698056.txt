Structures of the carbohydrate moiety attached to one site in the first domain of turkey ovomucoid: elucidation by 1H-n.m.r. spectroscopy. 
1H-N.m.r. spectroscopy was used to elucidate the primary structures of the carbohydrate moiety attached to asparagine at residue 53 in the first domain of turkey ovomucoid, a serine proteinase inhibitor. The carbohydrate moiety is a heterogeneous mixture of three structurally closely related complex-type oligosaccharides. Of the total carbohydrate moiety, 61% is tetra-antennary with terminal galactose and with an intersecting N-acetylglucosamine, and containing an additional N-acetylglucosamine (10') attached to mannose (4'). Another 23% is tri-antennary with terminal galactose and with an intersecting N-acetylglucosamine. The remaining 16% is tri-antennary with terminal galactose (6 and 8 only), with an intersecting N-acetylglucosamine.
