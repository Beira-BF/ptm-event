Amino acid sequence of acylphosphatase from rabbit skeletal muscle. 
The complete amino acid sequence of acylphosphatase from rabbit skeletal muscle has been elucidated by automatic Edman degradation of peptides obtained from staphylococcal protease and trypsin digestions. The enzyme consisted of a single polypeptide chain of 98 amino acid residues, lacking only histidine. Its amino (N)-terminus was blocked by an acetyl group. The presented sequence of rabbit muscle enzyme was compared with those of equine and porcine muscle enzymes. There were four unique replacements, i.e., Arg-4, Asp-28, Arg-31, and Glu-56 in the sequences of both equine and porcine muscle enzymes were replaced by Gly, Gly, Lys, and Asp, respectively, in that of rabbit muscle enzyme. Extensive structural homology was observed among the three enzymes.
