Complete amino acid sequence of a membrane receptor for glycoproteins. Sequence of the chicken hepatic lectin. 
The chicken hepatic lectin is involved in the clearance of glycoproteins from circulation (Kawasaki, T., and Ashwell, G. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 6536-6543). The complete amino acid sequence of chicken hepatic lectin has been established by analysis of peptides generated by chemical cleavage at methionine or tryptophan residues. Larger BrCN fragments were further digested with trypsin, chymotrypsin, and clostripain. All sequences were determined by automated sequential Edman degradation. Extensive use was made of high performance liquid chromatography in the purification of peptides and identification of phenylthiohydantoin derivatives of amino acids. The complete sequence is: (formula: see text). The stretch of uncharged amino acids from residue 25 to 48 is a possible membrane-interaction region. Carbohydrate is attached to residue 67.
