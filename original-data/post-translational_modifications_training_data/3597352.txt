Complete amino acid sequence of 14 kDa beta-galactoside-binding lectin of chick embryo. 
The complete amino acid sequence of a soluble beta-galactoside-binding lectin (subunit MW 14,500) of chick embryo was determined. The protein consists of 134 amino acids beginning with serine and ending with glutamic acid, and its N-terminal was blocked with acetate. The agreement of the present result with that obtained from nucleotide sequence analysis (Y. Ohyama et al. (1986) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 134, 51-56) indicates the lack of a cleavable leader sequence. Internal homologies were observed in several regions along the polypeptide chain. The highest homology (55% identity) was found between residues 42-58 and residues 112-128. This suggests that chick 14 kDa lectin may have evolved via several gene duplications.
