Multiplicity of N-terminal structures of medium-chain alcohol dehydrogenases. Mass-spectrometric analysis of plant, lower vertebrate and higher vertebrate class I, II, and III forms of the enzyme. 
Ten different alcohol dehydrogenases, representing several classes of the enzyme and a wide spread of organisms, were analyzed for patterns of N-terminal structures utilizing a combination of conventional and mass spectrometric peptide analysis. Results show all forms to be N-terminally acetylated and allow comparisons of now 40 such alcohol dehydrogenases covering a large span of forms and origins. Patterns illustrate roles of acetylation in proteins in general, define special importance of the class I N-terminal acetylation, and distinguish separate acetylated structures for all classes, as well as a common alcohol dehydrogenase motif.
